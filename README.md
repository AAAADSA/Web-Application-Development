## 1. *Overview*
Melody Maven is designed to be a user-friendly platform for managing and hosting music events. It caters to both users (attendees) and administrators (event organizers) through distinct web pages and functionalities. 

## 2. *Key Pages for Users*

- *Home Page:* 
  This is the landing page where users can find general information about Melody Maven, including featured events. It’s designed to be visually engaging, showcasing current or upcoming events with easy navigation options to explore more.

- *Events Page:*
  Users can browse a list of all available events on this page. They can filter events based on various categories (such as date, genre, etc.) to easily find the event they are interested in attending.

- *Register Event Page:*
  For users interested in attending an event, the Register Event Page allows them to sign up or purchase tickets. The interface is simple, ensuring that users can quickly register with minimal effort.

- *About Us Page:*
  This page provides background information on Melody Maven, including its mission, team, and vision for connecting music lovers with events. It’s essential for building trust and transparency with users.

## 3. *Administrative Pages*

- *Admin Login Page:*
  This page is specifically for event organizers or site administrators to log into their account. It is secured to ensure that only authorized personnel can manage events and bookings.

- *Add Event Page:*
  Once logged in, administrators can use this page to add new events to the platform. They can enter key event details, such as the event name, date, venue, description, and ticket prices.

- *Manage Booking Page:*
  Admins can also manage event bookings here. They can view, edit, or cancel bookings. It provides a streamlined way to handle attendee registrations and monitor the success of events.

## 4. *User Flow*

The user experience is designed to be seamless:
1. Visitors land on the *Home Page* and explore events.
2. They can go to the *Events Page* for a more detailed list of events or *Register Event Page* to sign up directly.
3. If they are curious about the platform, they can visit the *About Us Page* to learn more about Melody Maven's background and objectives.

For event organizers, the flow is similarly intuitive:
1. They log in through the *Admin Login Page*.
2. They can then add events through the *Add Event Page*.
3. They manage bookings and attendee lists through the *Manage Booking Page*, ensuring smooth event execution.
